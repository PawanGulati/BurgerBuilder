# :hamburger: BURGER BUILDER :hamburger:
### :construction: **WORK IN PROGRESS** :construction:

###### A simple BurgerBuilder SPA made through REACT to build a burger of client's choice and order it. Every client will be autherized to see his own burger orders list he made(to be done ;p). Used FireBase as DB and hosted up at [BurgerBuilder](https://pawan-burger-builder.herokuapp.com/) through Heroku as a Cloud Platform. 

Sorry didn't displayed ingredient's costs in the app :sweat_smile:, will do soon but till then   

**INGREDIENTS COSTS**

| Ingredients  | Costs         |

| Salad        | $1            |

| Bacon        | $4            |
